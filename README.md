# Omni-Things
Currently only adds one item, the "Omni-Goggles". By combining them with various helmets from other mods, you can combine HUDs so that you can see both at the same time, without swapping out helmets, along with adding a few useful features that would work in the vanilla game.
Soon, there will also be a full armor set, and an "Omni-Tool", with similar concepts behind them.

"Omni-Goggles" currently have support for:
- Thaumcraft's Goggles of Revealing
- OpenPeripherals' Terminal Glasses
- Vanilla Night Vision
