# Omni-Things
Currently only adds two items, the "Omni-Goggles", and the "Omni-Tool". By combining them with various helmets from other mods, you can combine HUDs so that you can see both at the same time, without swapping out helmets, along with adding a few useful features that would work in the vanilla game.
Soon, there will also be a full armor set, and an "Omni-Tool", with similar concepts behind them.

"Omni-Goggles" currently have support for:
- Thaumcraft's Goggles of Revealing
- OpenPeripherals' Terminal Glasses
- Potion Module (includes Night Vision & Water Breathing)

The "Omni-Tool" has:
- Potions Module (includes Haste & Strength)
- Paxel Module
- Wrench Module (works with Thermal Expansion, PneumaticCraft, and BuildCraft)
